This is a front-end project I did in Integrify Fullstack Program. In the project I learned and managed to work with React, Redux Toolkit, Thunk, TypeScript, SCSS and got experiences of switching theme via CSS custom properties.

2. Click the row of table to show specific country detail information
3. Add a country to cart
4. A search box to search country by name
5. A menu to switch the application theme and remember the user's selection when user visit again
